        <h3>Flexx Slider Documentation</h3>
        <p>The Flexx-Slider uses CSS animation to continuously scroll through a series of images. It's default setting is to scroll through all the images (sliding left) until the last image and then begins again.  
         
         The CSS to enable the slider consists of "regular" CSS styling plus special CSS animation. This instance of the slider is configured with three images. The behavior of the slider can easily be changed by modifying the CSS for the slider. The comments in the CSS file will help you understand what CSS needs to be changed to achieve the desired effect.  </p>
          
        <p>A specific HTML structure and special set of Flex slider classes will need to be applied in your HTML to make it work properly. </p>
        <p>Your slider content can include regular "text" elements or images. If you want to super impose text on top of an image you will want the image to be a background image. The sample HTML includes and example of superimposed text. </p> 
        <p>The best documentation is the code itself so inspect away....</p>

                   This is a CSS based automated carousel that you can use 
                   in anywhere on your website to make it more dynamic.
               </p>
               <p>
                   It uses just pure CSS magic (animation) to make it work...so JavaScript is NOT required!  
               </p>

               <p>
                   It can be customized to fit your needs.  But make sure that you consult
                   the documentation before you do so...unless you are feeling adventurous.       
               </p>

                   Either way have FUN!  PS. Go Chargers! <br>No seriously...I mean GO!
